\title{Neural Network Dimensionality Reduction Visualization}
\usage{
nn_viz(X, y, dim = 2, center.scale = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix (n x m) representing the input features, where n is the number of samples and m is the number of features.}

\item{y}{A vector of length n representing the categories or labels corresponding to the input data.}

\item{dim}{Integer indicating the desired dimensionality of the visualization: 2 for 2D, 3 for 3D. Default is 2.}

\item{center.scale}{A logical (boolean) value indicating whether the data should be centered and scaled before processing.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
  \item{projected_data}{The data projected onto the lower-dimensional space using the neural network.}
  \item{transformation_matrix}{The weight matrix of the neural network's first layer used for dimensionality reduction.}
}
Additionally, a Plotly plot representing the data points in the reduced feature space,
with points colored by their categories is displayed.
}
\description{
Creates a 2D (or 3D) visualization of high-dimensional data using a simple
neural network.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  X <- matrix(rnorm(200), nrow = 100, ncol = 2)
  y <- sample(1:3, 100, replace = TRUE)
  nn_viz(X, y)         # 2D visualization
  nn_viz(X, y, dim = 3)  # 3D visualization
}
