\title{Visualization of Independent Views}
\usage{
independent_views(X, y, dim = 2, method = "all", center.scale = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A matrix (n x m) representing the input features, where n is the number of samples and m is the number of features.}

\item{y}{A vector of length n representing the categories or labels corresponding to the input data.}

\item{dim}{Integer indicating the desired dimensionality of the visualization: 2 for 2D, 3 for 3D. Default is 2.}

\item{method}{A character string specifying the reduction method to use ("pca", "nn", "catcca").}

\item{center.scale}{A logical (boolean) value indicating whether the data should be centered and scaled before processing.}
}
\value{
A grid of plotly subplots representing the independent views.
}
\description{
Creates 2 independent 2D views of the multidimensional data using the specified dimensionality reduction method, with subsequent views based on orthogonal projections to explore independent aspects of the data.
}
\examples{
X <- matrix(rnorm(100 * 6), nrow = 100)  # Example feature matrix
y <- sample(1:3, 100, replace = TRUE)    # Example category vector
independent_views(X, y, method = "pca")
}
